# TidyTuesday-Penguin

This is my first Tidy Tuesday project pulled to GitHub. Also this is my first experience commit my project from Rstudio to GitHub repo.

Dataset for the project was taken from penguin dataset. I have already put the dataset in csv file (please see `penguins.csv`)

The code comprise of two parts:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Imputation
2. Build model using random forest

I welcome any comment or feedback to improve the code.
